Steps to run the project:
-------------------------
Step 1: Build the dependecies:
        run mix deps.get

Step 2: Compile the project:
        run mix escript.build 

Step 3: To start the server,
        ./twitter server

Step 4: In a new window, here you have two options: 
        •	To run as interactive client 
        •	To run as simulator.


        as interactive client:
          ./twitter client 127.0.0.1 username

        eg: ./twitter client 127.0.0.1 sbantakal
            ./twitter client 127.0.0.1 santhosh


        as simulator:
          mix run proj4_1.exs a b
            -	a is the number of users to be registered.
            -	b is the number of tweet that each user has to make.

Steps to run the Test cases:
------------------------------
Step 1: run mix deps.get

Step 2: run mix escript.build , if you don’t do the step one first, then it might throw an error and then you will have to run & then do mix escript.build again.


Step 3: To start the server,
        ./twitter server

Step 4: In a new window run the below command
	 mix test --only tc:a
	
-	a is the test case number
-	sample run is as below
